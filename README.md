# Week 03: Python Libraries

This repository contains all the resources from the third session of the NYU Data Science Bootcamp. In the third week, we covered basic Python Libraries.

**Instructor:** Sagar Patel

The recording of the session can be found here:

## Practice task for Week 03 (Optional)
**NOTE:** These tasks are optional and only for your practice. They will not be graded but they can be shared with the instructor for feedback.

1. Clone the current repository to the local machine.
2. Find your tasks in the `task-week3` folder. </br>
   NOTE: The solution will be posted in the same folder on before the next session
3. Move the `task-week3` folder to your original repository (`username/data-science-bootcamp`) once the tasks have been solved.
   _DO NOT FORGET TO COMMIT THE CHANGES!_

## Final Capstone Project
**Submission due:** Week 09 and Week 10 of the Bootcamp

In the final project, you will apply the tools you have learned in this BootCamp to solve a realistic problem. </br>
Due to shortage in number of sessions and the fact that this BootCamp is beginner centric, it is **NOT** mandatory to present the project to obtain the certificate. The presentation and demo will be a good practice for you as the ability to present and organize is a fundamental, yet undervalued part of Data Science.

If you choose to present on the last session, fill out this form available [here](https://forms.gle/kZajRJPcvFFUiCNPA)

### Submission Requirements
1. A short presentation explaining your workflow and thought process (Should not exceed more than 10 minutes)
2. A short demo
3. 2-3 questions from the instructor </br>

The source code can be submitted on the GitHub repository for a better profile!

### What kind of projects can you take up?

1. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset and showcasing your observations
2. Training and deploying a Machine Learning model (Does not have to be too advanced)

### Where to look for topics and inspiration?

Feel free to check out popular websites such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) or be creative and try something of your own by looking for some open-source data
